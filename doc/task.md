# A sample project to represent C/C++ skillset

## Overview:

Write an application that will read each line of the input file and generates a Data structure to
represent the operator, operands and other necessary attributes of a RISC v instruction-set.

You need to **lexically** analyze, if the instruction in each line is valid or not and if valid push them
in your final list of Instructions and include other attributes of the instruction.

> Grammar you need to implement, for the time being
>
> > - **G0**: instruction format in each line,
> >   `<op code> <space> <list of operands separated by comma> <list of operands ends with space, newline, or hash sign>`
> > - G1: You have a static list of instructions op code.
> > - G2: Each instruction has a fixed number of operands.
> >   - `add, addi, sub, subi` have 3
> >   - `la, li` can have 2
> >   - `ecall` none
> > - G3: Bonus, operand can be of type register or a number.

> For example,
>
> - add `a2, a1, a0` is a valid instruction;
> - whereas `add a0, a1` is not a valid since it has two operands instead of three, ref G2
> - And `add a3 a0 a1 a2` is not valid because of G0
> - and `dummy a0, a1, a2` is not valid, since the operator itself is not a valid instruction,
>   ref: G1

Ignore the line that starts with `#` sign. (Bonus: ignore rest of the line when you find a hash sign
in the middle of the line)
Please let me clarify this at the very beginning, solving the above problem is not the highest
priority; weâ€™re mostly interested to learn about your exposure to C++ domain.

### **A sample RISC v assembly blog for beginners here:**

Sample Input:

```sh
#all instructions are valid in following

add a0, x0, x1
la a1, hello
li a3, 5
addi a2, x0, 5
subi a7, x0, 64
ecall
```

Features we are looking for in your application:

- C++ version needs to be 17+
- Makefile based project structure
- Hefty usage of OOP concepts, design patterns etc.
- Code optimization using features of latest C++ features
- For example, Templating, ConstExpr, Casting, Structure.
- Some tips are available here, https://abseil.io/tips/
- If you have questions, please understand these are kept deliberately open. Use your
  best assumption and we like to find how flexible your code is.
